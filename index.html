    Hello. I live in San Francisco with my life partner, Caitlin Garlow. I like working on different projects with my <a href='http://lukeallen.com/'>friends</a> and we have a list of ideas a mile long we haven't gotten to yet--sadly. I am the co-inventor of <a href="https://bbot.menu">Bbot</a>, a drink delivery system for bars and restaurants.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here are some things I liked in 2017: The Florida Project, Vice Principles, Stranger Things, Fargo and Get Out; watching Cloud 9 in League of Legends in between programming sessions; and consuming a bunch of podcasts.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Interests</strong></br>
    Javascript in all forms. Current project uses Angular 1/2 and Ionic. Python or even Objective C which I help do for my friend's <a href='https://seadronepro.com'>robot</a>. Letting my dog Loki be my product manager.
